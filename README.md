1.Make a simple useful JAVA console application that uses a tree structure.

2. Document your application
Introduce what is it?

This code provides a basic implementation of a Binary Search Tree in Java. You can expand it by adding more methods to perform operations like deletion, finding the minimum/maximum value, getting the height of the tree, and so on.

Describe what it can do ?

This Java code implements a basic BST with functionalities for inserting nodes, traversing the tree in sorted order, and searching for specific values. It provides a simple and interactive way to demonstrate the core concepts of BSTs.

Why did you make that kind of application and How does it contributes to you or the community ?

This simple BST application is a valuable tool for learning, practicing, and contributing to the community. It provides a solid foundation for understanding data structures, recursive programming, and problem-solving techniques, which are essential skills for any software developer.
